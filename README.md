# Installation Instructions
Our solution finds it's routes in the Fabric Samples used for HyperLedger and uses a similiar software stack, relying on IBM Linux One and Hyper Ledger Fabric.
The verbose instructions can be found at web-app/client and web-app/server.
From here you will need to run

    npm install
   Followed by
   
     npm start


# In Detail
Lupe is a food redistribution application developed around Blockchain technology is our submission for IBM’s Call for Code competition. While food waste was already a global issue, Covid-19 heightened its effects through not allowing food outlets to operate during lockdown, creating economic stress and scarcity within local communities. Our team successfully created an application which allows local communities to safely share or trade their inventory with others. It could be used during similar situations, such as natural disasters or humanitarian crises. Enterprises of different sizes can benefit from using our digital solution for stock management whilst also uplifting and supporting their local community in times of economic uncertainty. Lupe aims to connect businesses, charities and people.

Our app was developed with direct feedback from local businesses, councils and charities. The Lupe app allows all users to upload items to trade and search for others in their local area. A statement echoed from our stakeholders was how current delivery applications did not fit the individuals needs and that the service was too restrictive in how it can be used to save time (despite being charged at a premium). Operating enterprises struggled in setting up software-as-a-service delivery solutions such as JustEat or UberEats.  It was clear that businesses needed a simpler solution, that would provide them with more control as to how their stock would be managed. Uniquely, our solution also assists by donating excess stock to local councils, charities and food banks. This saves businesses money as they would otherwise be charged for the storage or refrigeration costs of perishables.

Lupe’s front-end was based on an open source framework, Angular, providing a single page, reactive layout that is easy to navigate with usability and accessibility in mind. This is to help people who are less comfortable with ordering online (such as the elderly, or disabled). Using IBM’s HyperLedger blockchain solution allowed us to construct smart contracts in JavaScript which acts as an API to handle transactions and the transfer of goods and supplies via the Front-End. The Blockchain allows us to construct a distributed ledger of supply transactions. This allows the user to verify the history of where food has been to ensure it hasn’t been tampered with, mitigating the risk of security breaches. User’s can view an item’s recent location and journey from a hotel stockroom, to a charity and then to their door. Our system is entirely hosted on IBM’s Linux One infrastructure.

We wanted Lupe to be future proof so that it could adapt to suit various needs and demands. With the potential for further development such as incorporating a delivery route algorithm; identifying the most at risk areas of food scarcity and even highlighting local heroes and more. Lupe has the potential to be used as the first protocol in the distribution of food during a crisis, such as a local lockdown. It enables the essential flow of perishable goods between individuals, businesses and charities.
